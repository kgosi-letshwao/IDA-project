# IDA-project

OVERVIEW
In this project we were tasked with analysing a data set about crime in Los Angeles. the main aim was to deliver a report to the chief of polic highlighting main crimes committed in the area so to aid in deciding what measure to put in place to prevent, minimise or mitigate crimes and their effects. With this project i was solely responsible to starting and completing the project,with no partner. the project included importing the dataset, identifying defects, cleaning the data, creating visualisations, creating an interactive dashboard and finally giving recommendations to the crime department.

DATA DESCRIPTION
source:the dataset was sourced from kaggle,using the following link; https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/crime-incidents-in-los-angeles-2020-to-present
variables:the variables of the data set were about 30, ranging from date of report, date of crime occurence, time of occurence, area code, area name, crime committed, victim age, victim sex etc just to name a few. 

CLEANING OBJECTIVES
the data set defects that i had identified were as follows:
missing values were evident and they were replaced with the mean as this would preserve the distribution's central tendency.
inconsistency in data recording as some values were written twice for seperate values while pertaining to the same figure.to rectify for this, the values were rewritten as a single value to standardise the data.
outliers were also among the data defects, identified using scatter plots. the extreme values were then removed so to limit their effect on the intergrity of the data.

TOOLS USED
the platforms used in the ;roject were as follows:
rapid miner: it was used for data analysis thus to identify errors, identify variables that may be of less importance etc
microsoft excel: it was used to draw analysis charts from the cleaned data as per the project's requirement. another use was for building an interactive dashboard that incorporates multiple views of the crimes committed in LA.

SUMMARY REPORT
at the end, a fully fleshed document depicting the entire process was drawn.an interactive dashboard was also created, which would help the crime department to view the data from different angles. the documentation will be uploaded.
